* Pengchong Wang        UNI: `pw2480`      


## 2. Project Description 
We would like to implement a /Piazza/ on our own and add a few more functions to improve it.  Student can interact with instructors with Posts. One of the functions we want to add is *Votes*. Further, we will reorder the *post list*  and *answer list* by this score like /Reddit/. The other additional function is that we will expand the domain of this tool to *Event Organizer.* This project will include entities such as *Post, Comment, User, Tag, Course, Vote, Instructor, Student* and so on. *User* can be *instructor and Student*.  *Post* have attributes such as *Content, Views, Thank_Number, Status*. Course will have some attributes such as *Number, Term, Name*. We will make up our own data by conversing  content from piazza and inserting some random users. User can also enrolled in many courses. They can reply to comments and posts, add questions to their favorite and vote for the questions they think is valuable. Specific user can pin questions or comments and choose whether questions are resolved.

## 3. Contingency Plan
I will not implement the entities such as *Vote, Organizer, Event*. only implement the basic function of piazza with 4 entities: *User, Course, Post and Comment*.

#### Display all replies in piazza
```

```

## 4. Descriptions of any changes
* Modified the comment table so that it has a partial key, primary key (c_id, p_id), because it is a weak entity of questions.
* Modified the reply table to make sure comment reply to comment and both of them belongs to the same question
* Separated multiple relations between user and organization
* User can enroll in any organization as an instructor or a student.
* Deleted up number and down number, because it can be calculated from vote table
* Modified Tag table, add primary key t_id
