## 2. Project Description 
We would like to implement a /Piazza/ on our own and add a few more functions to improve it.  Student can interact with instructors with Posts. One of the functions we want to add is *Votes*. Further, we will reorder the *post list*  and *answer list* by this score like /Reddit/. The other additional function is that we will expand the domain of this tool to *Event Organizer.* This project will include entities such as *Post, Comment, User, Tag, Course, Vote, Instructor, Student* and so on. *User* can be *instructor and Student*.  *Post* have attributes such as *Content, Views, Thank_Number, Status*. Course will have some attributes such as *Number, Term, Name*. We will make up our own data by conversing  content from piazza and inserting some random users. User can also enrolled in many courses. They can reply to comments and posts, add questions to their favorite and vote for the questions they think is valuable. Specific user can pin questions or comments and choose whether questions are resolved.

## 3. Contingency Plan
I will not implement the entities such as *Vote, Organizer, Event*. only implement the basic function of piazza with 4 entities: *User, Course, Post and Comment*.
